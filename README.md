Welcome to my collection of Python mini-projects using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Data Visualization libraries** like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**!  
Each project focuses on a real-world dataset and applies various **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis**, and **visual storytelling** techniques.



##  Projects Included

###  Project 1: Netflix EDA
- Cleaned and analyzed Netflix titles dataset
- Explored genres, release trends, country-wise production, and ratings
- Visualized using Seaborn & Matplotlib


###  Project 2: World Population Analysis
- Loaded and cleaned UN population data (2014‚Äì2024)
- Analyzed trends by country, continent, and year
- Visualized population growth using Plotly
