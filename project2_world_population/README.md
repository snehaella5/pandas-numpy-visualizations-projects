#  World Population Analysis (2014–2024)

This data analysis project explores global and country-level population trends from 2014 to 2024. Using Python and a Kaggle dataset, we analyze growth rates, population density, and make basic projections using machine learning models.


##  Project Objectives

- Analyze global population growth from 2014 to 2024  
- Compare trends across selected countries  
- Calculate and visualize year-on-year growth rates  
- Evaluate population density using estimated land area  
- Predict future population using basic linear modeling (India as a case study)


##  Features

- **Global population trends** (2014–2024)
- **Country-wise comparisons** (India, China, US, Nigeria, Indonesia)
- **Population density analysis** (2024)
- **Growth rate visualization** (YoY % change)
- **Predictive modeling** (India's projected population for 2025–2030)
- Clean, readable plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

##  Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- Dataset Source: Kaggle

 
 Key Insights
The global population grew steadily between 2014 and 2024.

India and Indonesia show strong upward trends; China’s growth is slowing.

Indonesia had the most consistent annual growth.

India's population is projected to exceed [X] million by 2030.
